<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
Since 2006, we have been owned by 25 ferrets. Since ferrets only <br>live on average between 5-7 years,  it is difficult for some to handle the heart break.<br>
We fell in love with ferrets when our son asked for a ferret for Christmas.<br> We adopted 2 on Christmas Eve 2006. We lost one of our first ferret when he was only <br>2 years old.
We lost some that were almost 8 years old. <br>Ferrets are amazing pets that require a lot of love, care, attention, and give back so much more.
