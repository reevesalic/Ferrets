<p>
I've had a total of 25 ferrets since 2006. The <b>average </b> age of a ferret is between 5-7 years. <br>This is a list of the common illnesses in ferrets. <br>

All of the items on this list will be fatal if not treated. Not all conditions listed are treatable but there are<br>
options to slow down the progressive diseases. Vet care is critial for ferrets.
