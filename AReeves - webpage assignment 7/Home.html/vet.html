<h1> Finding a Vet</h1>

<p> Finding a quality vet can be very difficult. You need to find someone that is an exotic vet. <br>
(I travel 2 hours (an hour each way) for a good vet. Even if the person that answers the phone says they see ferrets,<br>
they may not be very knowledgable. <br>
<br>

You can interview the veterinarian and ask questions to find out if they are knowledable.<br>
The first quesion I ask the vet is what can they tell me about treating a ferret for adrenal disease<br>
or what are the symptoms of insulinoma. </p> <br>
