<h1 id="Caring"> Caring for your ferret</h1>
<p>
Ferrets require time, patience, understanding, ferret proofing, education, proper care and love.
</p>

<p>
Ferrets are very social animals. Most of them love to cuddle with humans or other ferrets.<br>
They are very smart and curious. You have to ferret proof your house since they can fit into small places.<br>
If their head can fit through an opening, they flatten out their body and can squeeze through.<br>
They require a lot of care. You have to cut their nails every 2 weeks, clean their ears and brush their teeth.<br>
Since ferrets are very curious and smart they require constant stimulation. They become bored very quickly<br>
and get depressed and will get into trouble if they do not have enough play time.<br>
<br>
Ferrets can be nippy when they are young but often grow out of their nippy stage.<br>
When ferrets are babies they are called kits. When ferrets become 5 years of age, they should be vetted <br>
more frequently as they can develop quite a few medical issues.<br>

Ferrets are carnivores and need plenty of protein. Some people feed them raw meat. It is believed ferrets<br>
do not get salmonella poisoning because their digestive tract is so small, they dispose of their food before it<br>
affects them. Some people feed their ferrets high quality kibble. The key is looking at the ingredients <br>
if it has peas or anything other than meat in the first 8 ingredients it is best to pass. <br>
Cat kibble is the best to feed your ferret but it is important to look at the ingredients. <br>
